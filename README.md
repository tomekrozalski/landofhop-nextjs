# Land of Hop - NextJS

My fourth attempt to build Land of Hop application with Next JS. Previously I had issues with creating multilingual pages and static sites, but meantime NextJS evolved and I believe now it gonna work nicely.

# Finish work

Work with NextJS, after experience with Gatsby and CRA, was real pleasure. I didn't think that I will say it, but... it is still not enough. The code gets complex, hard to read, forms get hairy. That is why I decided to rewrite the project in [SvelteKit](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-sveltekit)

  "about.body": "**Land of Hop** is a web application which I develop to practice programming skills (React, Next, Node, Nest, MongoDB). It is catalog of beers which I have drunk since October 2017. I work on it [almost every single day](https://github.com/tomekrozalski). For now, it is quite poor, because I focus on the technical aspects of building the application, but I will try to systematically add new functionalities to it.
